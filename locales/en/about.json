    "about_text02": "However, it wasn't until later in life that he discovered his true passion for coding. He has always been something of a tech enthusiast, but the moment he truly fell in love with programming came when he was trying to teach his mother how to use her new smartphone. After several hours of trying to explain how to send a text message (among other things), he turned to his own computer and exclaimed, `You know what, you're a machine, and if I can teach my mom how to use a smartphone, I can definitely learn to code, Porra!Â´",
    "about_text03": "With that declaration, he embarked on a journey of self-discovery, pouring countless hours into learning programming languages and mastering the art of coding. Through sheer determination and a wry sense of humor, he taught himself the skills needed to become a successful developer.",
