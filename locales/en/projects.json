That sounds like a superpower!' And you know what? You're right! My coding skills are so advanced that I can bend CSS rules with my mind and summon React components with a snap of my fingers. Anyway, I've put my heart and soul into these projects, and I'm sure they'll make you laugh, cry, and maybe even question your existence. I separate them into two categories so take a look around, and prepare to be amazed. And if you have any questions or comments, feel free to reach out."
